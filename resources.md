## Scripts and other resources

### Scripts
In our repository ([link](https://github.com/HEAPLab/linux-rt-science/)) you can find three scripts
that can help you in the use of Linux PREEMPT_RT to run scientific workload:
- `rtsyscheck.sh`: to check if the system is correctly configured according to the [guidelines](./configure-system.md).
- `rtps.sh`: similar to the `ps` command, but dedicated to real-time processes.
- `rtproc.sh`: to check the information of a given real-time process.

Please check the [README](https://github.com/HEAPLab/linux-rt-science/blob/main/README.md) file for
further information.

The scripts are released under the [Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/HEAPLab/linux-rt-science/blob/main/LICENSE).
